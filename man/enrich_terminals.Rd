\title{Enrich flattened parse table}
\usage{
enrich_terminals(flattened_pd, use_raw_indention = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{flattened_pd}{A nested parse table that was turned into a flat parse
table using \code{\link[=extract_terminals]{extract_terminals()}}.}

\item{use_raw_indention}{Boolean indicating wheter or not the raw indention
should be used.}
}
\description{
Enriches a flattened parse table with terminals only. In particular, it is
possible to compute the exact position a token will have (line and column)
when it will be serialized.
}
\details{
Since we have only terminal tokens now, the line on which a token
starts we also be the line on which it ends. We call \code{line1} the line on
which the token starts. \code{line1} has the same meaning as \code{line1} that can be
found in a flat parse table (see \code{\link[=tokenize]{tokenize()}}), just that the \code{line1}
created by \code{enrich_terminals()} is the updated version of the former
\code{line1}. The same applies for \code{col1} and \code{col2}.
